An image with a chessboard, only one would be enough, but in this example we have 3!

### annotation

Now we need some chessboard corners for camera calibration, the user interface for clicking the corners is quit neat!

### object

Here we need an object in PLY format. The format the meshlab can view!

### Output

The dinasour can now appear anywhen on the board.
